- backup .storage

- temporary change schedule or defer only for today
  x add "skip for today" button for due goals
    basically just stops notification


- make notifications more disruptive
  play louder sounds
  - this is to make sure time limit is followed
    since I've doing way past 15 minutes for some goals


- allow minutes in invervals
  try to use it as space repetition

- presets, or default goals
  will serve as an example on how to use

- motivators
