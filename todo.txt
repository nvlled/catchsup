- move each log note to a separate .md file
  - this will reduce write size as well
    logs/$goalid-1.json // [...]
    logs/$goalid-2.json // [...]

- rotated backups for good measure



- fix infinity duration when 0 goals


- do not use persist middleware
  - listen for state changes and throttle saving
  - add manual call to save() on for some actions 


- fuck, data gets deleted
  - make a backup dir with timestamps
  - show user error if data file exists and
    data failed to be parsed

  - I should probably not use zustand for auto serialization
    but it's possible that the data got corrupted when
    my laptop ran out of battery

- check if current scheduled goal has auto schedule,
  and check if there are any due goal that has a fixed time set

- show on homepage the due goals with particular time set

- update readme
  - add screenshots
  - note: yes it's electron, fight me
  - download
  - autorun
    - add to windows autorun

    - on linux, it depends on your desktop environment
      on kde, search autostart
      on gnome: https://askubuntu.com/questions/37957/how-do-i-manage-applications-on-startup-in-gnome-3
      anything else, you are on your own, you'll figure it out
      maybe try .xinitrc

- to add a cherry on top, make a shitty landing page too

- one more final fixes and simple polishes  
  - default example goals
  - add title to logs, so the title remains
    even when the goal is removed

  - move git branch to mvp
    and create clean main branch

- commit and make a release in github

- add minutes input next to start button


- show reward when limit has been passed
  - drag & drop files (or manually open) for reward
  - keep track of files already shown


- better UI for day selection
