- backup .storage

- remove time ranges like early morning, late morning, etc.
  the time span is just too large to be meaningful
  better to have a more precise time to set

- add option trainingTime: any time (notifications for this will be hourly)
  add option "limit goals per day"

- add next to start button:
  your time budget: 120 (min)
  [start] [15 min] [-5][+5]

- (planned) 
  Always set trainingDuration to 15 minutes.
  Add something like "points" to each goal. 
  Every time a user finishes a goal, they earn a point.
  The points can then be used to extend time.
  What for? To avoid overdoing. A user may spend too much
  time in a single day, making the method less useful
  as the user may give up sooner.
  I'm thinking, if I can do a task for more than an hour,
  then I probably don't need this tool for that, as I already
  have enough motivation to do that.
  The tool would be most useful for new or uncomfortable things.
  Having more restriction would be good to prevent the user
  from going off-rails.
  Otherwise, the app would just be a fancy notification tool.
  
- (planned)
  remove trainingTime, but limit due 2-3 goals per day
  if there are more than 3 goals are done for a day,
  then stop notifications.

- test on windows

- presets, or default goals
  will serve as an example on how to use

- use scss modules

----------------

- motivators
