- fix remainingHours bug
  looks like it only doesn't get immediately updated
  after completing a goal

- use svg icons for the spinner

- break lines by words, not by letter
- disable autoadjust on read book: pos
- add visual interruption too
  alternate between aural and visual

- decrease available "no disturb" durations
  for every click made by 60%,
  this way I don't just keep clicking
  no disturb for a whole day,
  like what I did yesterday

- allow cancel even if time is up
  for cases when there's a blackout
  and I didn't get to do anything

- make some shitty landing page

- one more final fixes and simple polishes  
  - move git branch to mvp
    and create clean main branch
    because I will most definitely be 
    judged on my messy initial commits


- show reward when limit has been passed
  - drag & drop files (or manually open) for reward
  - keep track of files already shown


- better UI for day selection
