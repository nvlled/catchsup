- good enough for enough
  clean up code then commit 
  then do no disturb buttons next

---------------------------------

- do not show no-disturb when there is no active goal
- decrease available "no disturb" durations
  for every click made by 60%,
  this way I don't just keep clicking
  no disturb for a whole day,
  like what I did yesterday
  - hide cancel no-disturb after 1min of no-disturb period
  - when a button is clicked, reset interrupt cycle back to start

  - buttons: 5min 15min 30min 1h 2h 
  - 1h is clicked
  - buttons: 5min 15min 30min 
  - 15min is clicked
  - buttons: 5min 30min 
  - 30min is clicked
  - buttons: 5min
  - 15min is clicked
  - buttons: --

- distraction window
  - a shark that swims in the screen
  - a gorilla head that floats around
  - the window shows up briefly then hides
  - the window should just be plain html,
    and let the parent window control the child window
    
- states:
  init_day, no_goal, scheduled_goal, started_goal, cooldown, end_goal

interruption progession cycle
- n=notification, lvs=low vol sound, nvs=normal sound, sw=small window, bw=big window
1.  n
2.  n+lvs
3.  n
4.  n+sw
5.  n
6.  n+nvs
7.  n
8.  n+bw
9.  n
10. n+nvs+bw
11. goto 5


- convert schedulerService.onUpdate to a proper coroutine-ish state machine
  - fix remainingHours bug
    looks like it only doesn't get immediately updated
    after completing a goal

- maybe todo
  - use sqlite
  - use trpc/electron

- volume adjust
  - 

- add visual interruption too
  alternate between aural and visual
  - for visual interruptions, just create another
  window that moves around


- show reward when limit has been passed
  - drag & drop files (or manually open) for reward
  - keep track of files already shown


- better UI for day selection
