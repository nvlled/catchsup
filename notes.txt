New changes:
- only one goal should be due at a time
  on the home screen, show the due goal at the top,
  and add button below it to show all goals at the bottom

- the default should be that goal have no particular
  scheduled time

- remove all other tray icons besides
  due-now and default logo

- scheduling priority
  1. due goals with specific time
  2. due goals with specific range
  3. due goals with no specific time
  4 last session time
  - add custom priority to goal (applies only to (3) and (4))

- max session hours
- min/max times a goal can be done in a day

- notification frequency or interruptiveness should change
  on the elapsed time since the goal was due
  - make a gorilla run around the screen

- one-time tasks

- cooldown time
  like when I need to stop reading, and take notes

- redefine terms to something less imperative
  - goal
  - training



refactor, do this later after changes have been made
- simplify schedulingData
  schedulingData: {
    dayilyInterval: number;
    dayOfWeeks: SetOfWeekDays;
    dayOfMonths: SetOfDates;
  };

My reason for this is that I find manual scheduling
at certain hours not very helpful. Ideally,
what I want the app to do this is:
give me something to do right now, 
I don't particularly care which,
just something. Don't make me decide,
as that adds more friction to doing it.

I don't care what particular time I 
want to do something. Initially, I thought
specific times can be used as a prompt or trigger
for actions. In practice, it doesn't work.

Of course, I'm not removing manual scheduling,
as that might have use cases later on.
But default would be to just auto-schedule.

- change background color to dark tomato red #FF6347, because why not?
  white background and black text is so dull to look at,
  and I stare at it a lot. Being dull is the point?
  What about manga, is that dull to look at?
  No, manga and drawing are a completely different matter.

# Fix or improve due notifications

## Example case
goal sched: late morning

current time: 10:30

The question is how often would it spam
notifications? Will it just keep spamming
until 12:00?

Solutions:
- remove time ranges and just put exact time
- send notifications only every 30 minutes

-----------------------

uhh, I noticed there are a lot of open and
unresolved issues in neutralinojs. At this rate,
I might just consider using electron instead.
Or I could just avoid using systray, not
really an important feature.
Then again, I think moving to electron
wouldn't be too hard. I hardly used
any unique or specific neutralino API.

other issues that maybe I can fix:
- wrong typescript definitions
- the react sample repo doesn't work without building it first
- neutralino keeps overwriting the script path

The more I spend time with neutralino, the
more I see problems. The maintainers are also
possibly inactive as well, or unresponsive.
Probably busy with other things.
But at this point, neutralino is more like
WIP side project. The glacial development pace
is kind of expected, given the C++ codebase.

Well, none of that matters for me. It
works for me for my use case. I kind of wish
they would fix the linux systray bug.


--------------------

# systray icon

## no active goal
show symbol of nearest due goal
- orange (due now, ready)


## active goal
show green to indicate it's running
show red to indicate it's time to stop

SystrayController = {
  loop() {
    if (timeUp) {

    }
  }
  start() {
    setInterval(this.loop)
    onStartGoal(() =>{

    })
    onUpdateDueState(() => {

    })
  }
}



------------------------------------

after start button has been pressed
play prompt sound, then slowly fade out

then after done button is pressed, play reward sound
that fades out.

dueGoals = state.goals.filter(Goal.isDueNow)

I could let it poll for due goals for every 3 minutes,
then send notification if there is at least one due.
If there are several goals, just send one notification
for each poll.

Don't send notification when window is focused.
