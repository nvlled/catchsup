# Fix or improve due notifications

## Example case
goal sched: late morning

current time: 10:30

The question is how often would it spam
notifications? Will it just keep spamming
until 12:00?

Solutions:
- remove time ranges and just put exact time
- send notifications only every 30 minutes

-----------------------

uhh, I noticed there are a lot of open and
unresolved issues in neutralinojs. At this rate,
I might just consider using electron instead.
Or I could just avoid using systray, not
really an important feature.
Then again, I think moving to electron
wouldn't be too hard. I hardly used
any unique or specific neutralino API.

other issues that maybe I can fix:
- wrong typescript definitions
- the react sample repo doesn't work without building it first
- neutralino keeps overwriting the script path

The more I spend time with neutralino, the
more I see problems. The maintainers are also
possibly inactive as well, or unresponsive.
Probably busy with other things.
But at this point, neutralino is more like
WIP side project. The glacial development pace
is kind of expected, given the C++ codebase.

Well, none of that matters for me. It
works for me for my use case. I kind of wish
they would fix the linux systray bug.

# systray icon

## no active goal
show symbol of nearest due goal
- orange (due now, ready)


## active goal
show green to indicate it's running
show red to indicate it's time to stop

SystrayController = {
  loop() {
    if (timeUp) {

    }
  }
  start() {
    setInterval(this.loop)
    onStartGoal(() =>{

    })
    onUpdateDueState(() => {

    })
  }
}



------------------------------------

after start button has been pressed
play prompt sound, then slowly fade out

then after done button is pressed, play reward sound
that fades out.

(?) You can keep on going if you want,
but note you may want to initially pace yourself
when building a new habit.

goals = [

    {title: "b", sched: "every 3 days morning"},
    {title: "c", sched: "once a month morning"},
]

date: monday 6:00
dueGoals = state.goals.filter(Goal.isDueNow)

I could let it poll for due goals for every 3 minutes,
then send notification if there is at least one due.
If there are several goals, just send one notification
for each poll.

Don't send notification when window is focused.
