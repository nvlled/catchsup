# Catchsup

Catchsup is a tool to help you to learn a new habit or skill.
It conceptually similar to pomodoro in that it helps you get
started, but it also helps to do it consistently, until
it becomes a habit.

## Installation and setup

1. Download program from https://github.com/nvlled/catchsup/releases
2. Put the downloaded program in your preferred folder
3. (Optional) Add the program in your autorun. As this depends on the OS and your
   setup, you have to look up instructions on how to do this.

Note: On linux, you have to do something like `chmod +x catchsup.AppImage` to run it.

### What's the autorun for?

Because catchsup is a habit building tool,
it has to be running most of the time, and it must automatically
run when you start your computer. If you have to manually start it
every time, chances are you will forget about it.

## Usage

See instructions in the program.
